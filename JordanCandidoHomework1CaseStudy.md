# CASE STUDY OF M1 FINANCE

## Overview and Origin

* M1 Finance

* M1 Finance was incorporated in 2015.

* The founder and current CEO is Brian Barnes.

* Barnes started investing at a young age, since fifth grade. His teacher had assigned him a mock-investing project and his parents gave him some money to invest in the real markets. In his older years, Barnes wanted an easy way of investing as he could not find the features he was looking for. He had much criticism of financial advisors and the fees they were charging so he decided to create his own platform.

* M1 Finance is currently a private company and obtains funding through Series Funding with private investors. The company recently completed a Series D funding round for $75 million USD and have received a total of $173.2 million USD.


## Business Activities:

* The company's mission is to empower the people to take control of their own finances. Their products aim to make investing simple and automated while also providing finance and wealth management tools that are set by the customer. 

* The company's intended customer is any current or new investor who wants to invest in a simple and automated manner. The founder and CEO expressed his criticism about financial advisors and how much they charge their customers. Therefore, the company is targeting the same customer base of these financial advisors and offer these customers more freedom and structure to their finances. A 2019 study showed that only 17% of Americans use financial advisors with 75% of Americans managing their own finances. 

* The company uses software that allows the customers to create their own investment pies that can be composed of many different types of equities where each is assigned a specific percentage or weighting. Customers can simply use their cash to purchase these pies and have their money automatically spread out between the companies in the pie with the specific allocation they had set. 

* The company uses a mobile phone application software that connects to financial market data and acts as a brokerage. Not much information can be found on the exact technology that is being used by the company. However, the company uses services from other entities such as banks for chequing and savings accounts. The company most likely uses API through their mobile application and uses fundamentals of wealth management to structure clients portfolios to provide simplified and automated finances. 

## Landscape:

* M1 Finance falls under the financial domains including but not limited to: investment management, wealth management, personal finance/deposits/online banking and robo-advisory.

* There has been a significant increase in demand from younger generations that are looking for new technologies to make investing and wealth management more simple and automated. innovations in the fintech space have accelerated the creation of new tools that can appeal to a new technological and automated world that will eventually become part of the mainstream. 

* Other major companies in this domain include: Robinhood, Wealth Simple, WeBull and Questrade.

## Results

* The company has attracted some investors who are looking for a simpler and more automated approach to investing. The company's product of creating investment pie's is unique to any other financial institution. 

* One important metric for the company is the amount of Assets Under Management (AUM) that in 2020 were $1 billion and in 2021 were $3 billion; a 200% increase. This metric shows that the customer base in investing more money with M1 Finance. 

* The company is in the early growth stages where as other companies like Robinhood have completed their Series G which is now worth $660 million. Relative to the current size and valuation of Robinhood, M1 Finance is growing at a faster pace even though it is 1/5 the size.

## Recommendations

* If i were the company I would focus on bringing the product outside of the US to increase possible customer acquisition. I would also focus on products that target simple ways of investing for example, automatic investment settings along with automatic deposits. I would also try to bring in cryptocurrencies where diversification and pie creation can also be extremely beneficial.

* These services would directly target the company's customer of choice that focuses on investors looking for simple and automated ways of investing while still having control and structure in their investments.

* The technologies would include services provided by banks and also blockchain services provided by crypto exchanges or platforms. M1 Finance already has partnered with technologies from banks for simple chequing and savings accounts. 

* These are the technologies that are directly involved with providing these services to the customer. Especially now when crypto currency is highly hyped and discussed in the mainstream, it would attract more funding and marketing for the company.
